OQS-BoringSSL snapshot 2020-07
==============================

About
-----

The **Open Quantum Safe (OQS) project** has the goal of developing and prototyping quantum-resistant cryptography.  More information on OQS can be found on our website: https://openquantumsafe.org/ and on Github at https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/.

**liboqs** is an open source C library for quantum-resistant cryptographic algorithms.

**open-quantum-safe/boringssl** is an integration of liboqs into (a fork of) BoringSSL.  The goal of this integration is to provide easy prototyping of quantum-resistant cryptography in TLS 1.3.  The integration should not be considered "production quality".
